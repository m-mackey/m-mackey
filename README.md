### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Megan! 

ðŸŒ± I'm a budding web developer currently learning full stack JavaScript via the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com). I feel like I've grown quite a bit recently. Things seem to click a bit more easily into place, my workflow has really improved, and in general I feel more comfortable and confident. 

:floppy_disk: Me as a developer: When making personal projects, I think it's fun to make them a bit silly, but still as well-built as possible under the hood. I like to make my sites responsive as soon as I can, and build for mobile first. I've been using WSL2 and I think it's kinda neat.

âš¡ Fun stuff: I like music, video games, dramas, and traveling!
